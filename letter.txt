Welcome to Bloc 11 and thank you for joining us! We hope you have a fantastic experience.

Here are a few rules that will make your visit at Bloc 11 the most enjoyable experience for everyone. Please read them carefully as they include important safety precautions. 

*	Climbs finish on the last hold of the colour, no topping out or grabbing the top!

*	Never sit or walk under a climber on the wall, unforeseen bails are part of the sport

*	Injuries happen when athletes overdo it. Know your limits and take rests.
 
*	The difficulties of Bloc 11 climbs are following the colour scheme from white as the easiest to blue – black – purple – yellow – red and green, the chart is viewable from the wall

*	Please do not park in front of our neighbours! We have a parking lot around the corner (take the driveway passage under the   ‘Island Park’ sign, 50m to the LEFT of Bloc 11) Here's the map of the surroundings:

As climbing is a dangerous sport by nature it is imperative that the safety rules are followed at all times. Therefore disregarding these rules may lead to termination of membership.

Have fun and best regards,

Your Bloc 11 Team
